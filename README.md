# Welcome to your NativeWind React Native App ðŸ‘‹

This is a [React Native](https://reactnative.dev) project set up with [NativeWind](https://www.nativewind.dev) and [Expo](https://expo.dev).

## Get started

1. Clone the repository

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rajshah04/reactnative_nativewind_setup.git
   ```

2. Change to the project directory

   ```
   cd reactnative_nativewind_setup
   ```

3. Install dependencies

   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the app

   ```
   npm start
   ```


In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
